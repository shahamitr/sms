Docx-to-HTML
============

Converts .docx files to HTML

This is a PHP class that will convert your .docx files to HTML. It is by far not perfect, but will handle most things decently.

###How to use

```
$doc = new Docx_reader();
$doc->setFile('/path/to/docx/file.docx');

$html = $doc->to_html();
$plain_text = $doc->to_plain_text();

```
